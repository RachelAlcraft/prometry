# Summary

PROMETRY is a library for geometric paramters of protein structures.
PROMETRY is able to contact maps ... 

PROMETRY provides a method to both assist protein prediction by the easy input data, and validation of those inputs looking at the geometric paramaters they produce.  has applications in protein structure prediction as input data and provides a method both .



PROMETRY is implemented in Python, using bipython, the pdb and AlphaFold for atomic coordinates of proteins. 

PROMETRY is tested by github actions on repository commit. 

The documentation for PROMETRY can be found [here]().


# Statement of need and main contributions

There has been an uptake in interest in protein geometry with the release of AkphaFold. There is now a proliferation of protein structures of varying quality and the ability to discern genuine protein is becoming neceasaary.

PROMETRY faciolitaes the doscivery of statstical metrics to validate structgures, as well as creating data that can be fed into prediciton mdoels to improve strcuters.

The fast easily accessible gemetric daty ios aimed at enabling scientists to use this in thnie own applications.

Protein geometry is a long way from being new, very little has happened in the field since the 90s. This is to some detriment to the trapidly developing feild of pre=dicted structures as they are not being easi;ly validated - the oblicly available tools to validate structures work on a structure by struicture case, PORMTRY facioliates rapid multi structure analuysis to find probabl;e or unlikely data.

PROMETRY further adds to the field by making accessible a multitude of data anylses that are not rapisdly available in the puiblic domain - contact maps, hydrogen bond searches and nearest neighbour contacts between any atopms adds new functionality to the protein geometry applications avialable.
